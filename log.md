# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 9, 2018
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Restarted on Zen psd2html project.

**Thoughts:** Terrified, didn't understand much of my own code at first. At the end of the hour I made some things happen like magic. Very stressful.


### Day 2: Jan 10, 2018
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Wordpress Tutorial - Widgets and Comments

**Thoughts:** Tried to postpone, but got my gumption up and have now finished 1 hour and 5 minutes. Still terrified, I'm not sure why, I mean if I fail no big deal right? If I succeed?.
